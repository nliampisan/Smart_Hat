SMART HAT<h1>

Intro

Smart Hat is a hat that allows the visually impaired to experience the world as if they could actually see. Using the various sensors mounted on the raspberry pi, we capture the data from the outside world and analyze the data using our software which is then relayed to the user via an earpiece. The user is also able to interact with the raspberry pi through a joystick.
